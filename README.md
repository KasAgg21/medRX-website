Sure, here is a README for the Github repository in first person point of view, as if you have developed it:

medRX-website
I developed the medRX website. It is a research project that aims to develop a new drug discovery platform.

The website includes the following pages:

Home page: This page provides an overview of the medRX project.
About page: This page provides more detailed information about the medRX project.
Research page: This page describes the research that is being conducted as part of the medRX project.
Team page: This page introduces the team members who are working on the medRX project.
Contact page: This page provides contact information for the medRX project.
I hope this website helps people learn more about the medRX project and its mission to develop new drugs that can improve the lives of people around the world.

If you have any feedback or suggestions about the website, please feel free to contact me.

I am always looking for ways to improve the website and make it more informative and user-friendly.

Thank you for visiting the medRX website!
